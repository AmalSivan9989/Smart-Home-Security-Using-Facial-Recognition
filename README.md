# Smart-Home-Security-Using-Facial-Recognition
# Abstract
In the modern age of technology, enhancing home security systems has become imperative. This paper presents a novel approach to smart home security by integrating facial recognition, Internet of Things (IoT), and a web interface into a unified system. The proposed system leverages machine learning algorithms for accurate and real-time facial recognition to control access to a home. Upon successful recognition, an IoT-enabled servo motor is activated to unlock the door. A web interface developed using Flask allows users to monitor and control the system remotely, providing added flexibility and convenience. The system is designed to offer a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution to home security, addressing limitations in existing models. The implementation is discussed in detail, showcasing the advantages and potential modifications to further enhance the system's performance.

# ALGORITHM
The system captures a live video feed from a camera positioned at the entrance. The captured frames are processed to detect faces using the Haar Cascade Classifier. Once a face is detected, it is cropped, converted to grayscale, and resized to match the input dimensions required by the facial recognition model. The LBPH algorithm then extracts features from the face, generating a histogram that represents the local patterns of the image. The generated histogram is compared with the stored templates of authorized faces. If the similarity score exceeds a predefined threshold, the system concludes that the face is recognized, and the individual is granted access.
